    <h5>Singapore Poly launches country's first-ever solar photovoltaics recycling line</h5>
    <p>The first solar photovoltaics recycling line is being piloted at SP. The system involves a machine to take apart solar panels, so its components - including precious materials like silver and glass - can be recycled. It has a target recycling capacity of 80 panels a day and a recovery rate of up to 95%. Dr Thong Ta Xuan, Senior Research Scientist from TIE was interviewed. The Polytechnic has also established two laboratories - SP-Sembcorp Solar PV Research Lab and SP-CHINT Smart Electrical Power Training Laboratory  to enhance research and development in the field of solar energy.</p>
